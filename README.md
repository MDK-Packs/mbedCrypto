# mbedCrypto

This GitHub repository contains a mirror of https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto
and adds the infrastructure to wrap it as a [CMSIS-Pack](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Pack/html/index.html).

The development for Mbed Crypto is done on the upstream repository. This downstream project adds patches and additions to use Mbed Crypto in a CMSIS-Pack enabled build system.
